Repo to contain one continuous file of my learning nodeJS and working through Node School exercises


07/03/2018:
File starting at Lesson 6, lessons 1 - 5 I had already completed before adding to GitHub

Completed Lesson 6. Took a lot of thinking around it, understanding callbacks. Observation that documentation not the best, in terms of hint being clear that there are multiple callbacks. Potential project once complete LearnYouNOde, submit documentation update. On to Lesson 7.
